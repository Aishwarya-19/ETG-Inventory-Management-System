# ETG-Inventory-Management-System
This repository is having all the codes with json files for making an Inventory Management System during ETG ML/AI Internship

### I've made an inventory management system which is working on NoSQL based database
1. I've used JSON file system for it
2. New inventory can be added
3. product list can be viewed
4. Purchase can be done

I've added 5 features per product
1. Product ID
2. Name of Product
3. Quantity
4. Price
5. Tax(GST%)

My project can do the following things
1. Add items to inventory
2. Update the inventory
3. Ask user to display product list
4. Generate Bill
5. sales is also updated after every purchase
